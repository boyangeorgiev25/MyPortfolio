                <p>
                  Learning to make an AI that doesn't just move randomly was hard but super satisfying when it worked

                  First time using JavaFX to make something that looks decent and responds to clicks properly

                  Tried to follow best practices for organizing classes - professor was always talking about this stuff

                <h4>How Quarto works</h4>
                <p>
                  It's like tic-tac-toe but way more complex. You've got 16 different pieces with different shapes and colors. 
                  The weird part is you pick which piece your opponent has to use!

                <h4>How the AI thinks</h4>
                <p>
                  I programmed it with a bunch of rules like "if you can win, do it" and "if opponent can win, block them." 
                  It checks all possibilities and picks the best move. Pretty proud of how smart it turned out.

              <div className="feature-detail">
                <h4>Code organization</h4>
                <p>
                  Split everything into different files - one for the game rules, one for the graphics, one for the AI. 
                  Made it much easier to fix bugs and add new features without breaking everything.
