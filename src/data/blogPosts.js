# Everything Just Clicked: Aced My Exams and Landed My First Internship!

Hey everyone! So much has happened since my last post, I honestly don't even know where to start. But wow, what a crazy few months it's been!

## That Retake Exam? Totally Crushed It!

Remember how stressed I was about that retake exam? Well, turns out all that extra time studying actually paid off BIG time. When I got my results back, I couldn't believe it - I didn't just pass, I absolutely smashed it! 

All those hours I spent going through the material again, plus all the confidence I built up from my React projects over the summer, just came together perfectly. Looking back, failing the first time was probably the best thing that could have happened to me. I actually understand the stuff now instead of just memorizing it.

## Plot Twist: Got Hired at Jointly!

So here's the crazy part. I came back to Belgium thinking I'd just focus on my studies, maybe work on some more coding projects, you know? I wasn't even looking for a job or anything.

But then I heard about this internship at a company called Jointly through some connections, and I thought "why not give it a shot?" I'd never heard of them before, but when I looked into what they do, it seemed really cool.

Here's the insane timing though - I got hired exactly one month before my biggest, scariest exam yet. Like, this was supposed to be one of the hardest tests of my entire degree. I was freaking out thinking "how am I gonna balance a new job AND study for this monster exam??" But somehow it all just... worked out?

## The Interview Was Actually Fun

Okay, so you know how most interviews are super formal and they ask you all these theoretical questions that make you feel like you're back in an exam? This was totally different.

They actually wanted to see my React projects! All that time I spent coding over the summer because I was bored and stressed about my retake? Turns out that was exactly what they were looking for. They cared more about what I could actually build than what I could recite from a textbook.

## Juggling Work and Uni Life

Not gonna lie, balancing the internship with my KdG coursework has been intense. But in a good way? Like, suddenly all the theory I'm learning in class makes sense because I'm actually using it at work. 

My colleagues at Jointly are super smart and patient with all my student questions. It's like having extra tutors who show me how this stuff actually works in the real world. Way better than just reading about it in textbooks!

## Shoutout to My Friends

I have to give a massive shoutout to my Bulgarian friends here. These guys have been absolutely amazing through everything. When I was stressing about the retake, they kept me sane. When I got my exam results, they were the first ones celebrating with me. And when I told them about the Jointly job? Let's just say we may have celebrated a bit too hard that night ðŸ˜…

Having friends who get what it's like to be a foreign student here, but who also push you to go after opportunities, is honestly priceless.

## Can't Believe This Is My Life Now

Six months ago I was feeling pretty down about that failed exam, wondering if I was cut out for this whole computer science thing. Now I'm working at a tech company, acing my exams, and actually feeling like I know what I'm doing for once!

The weirdest part is how everything connected. The extra study time, the React projects, the timing of the job offer, even that scary exam - it all just clicked together like puzzle pieces.

I guess sometimes you just gotta trust that things work out, even when it doesn't feel like it at the time.

*Thanks for reading my rambling! Still can't believe this is actually happening ðŸŽ‰*

# Learning from Setbacks: My First Year Journey

As I prepare for an upcoming retake exam, I find myself reflecting on what has been a transformative first year at KdG University. While it didn't unfold exactly as I had envisioned, it taught me valuable lessons about resilience, friendship, and turning challenges into opportunities.

## Academic Reality Check

My first year at university brought both successes and challenges. While I successfully passed most of my coursework, one subject proved more difficult than anticipated. Initially, facing a retake felt disappointing â€“ watching classmates move forward while I had to revisit material was humbling.

However, I've learned to reframe this experience. The retake isn't just a second chance; it's an opportunity to truly master the concepts I initially struggled with. Sometimes the extra time allows for deeper understanding and stronger foundations.

## Building Meaningful Connections

One of the most rewarding aspects of my first year had nothing to do with coursework â€“ it was the friendships I developed with fellow Bulgarian students. What began as casual conversations between lectures evolved into genuine connections that would shape my entire university experience.

These international friendships offered unique perspectives on student life, cultural exchange, and shared academic goals. Despite our different backgrounds, we discovered common aspirations and experiences that bonded us as a supportive community.

## A Transformative Week Away

Following the completion of our first year, my Bulgarian friends and I planned a week-long trip together. This break came at the perfect time â€“ after the stress of exams and the initial disappointment of my academic setback.

The experience was exactly what I needed. We explored new destinations, experienced different cultures, and most importantly, gained perspective on what truly matters in student life. That week reminded me that university is about more than grades â€“ it's about personal growth, meaningful relationships, and creating lasting memories.

## Productive Summer Learning

Returning from our trip, I faced a decision: spend the summer anxious about my retake, or use the time constructively while preparing for my exam. I chose the latter approach.

I enrolled in a comprehensive React development course on Udemy, which proved to be one of my best decisions as a student. While balancing exam preparation, I dove into modern web development, discovering a genuine passion for React and its ecosystem.

## From Theory to Practice

The React course transformed my understanding of web development. Instead of purely theoretical learning, I was building functional applications, seeing immediate results, and understanding how code translates into user experiences.

This practical approach led to creating projects for my personal portfolio website. What started as course exercises evolved into a collection of work I'm genuinely proud to showcase. Each project reinforced my learning and demonstrated the practical applications of my computer science studies.

## Looking Forward

My first year taught me that setbacks can become stepping stones when approached with the right mindset. The combination of academic challenges, meaningful friendships, and self-directed learning has shaped my approach to both university and personal development.

*Here's to continued growth and learning in the years ahead!*

# Adapting to University Life in Belgium

Starting my Bachelor's in Applied Computer Science at Karel de Grote University (KdG) in Antwerp marked a significant transition in my life. Moving to a new country with different educational approaches, cultural norms, and daily routines presented both exciting opportunities and genuine challenges.

## Discovering KdG's Academic Approach

One of the most pleasant surprises during my first months was the teaching methodology at KdG. The lecturers demonstrate a genuine commitment to student success that extends far beyond traditional classroom instruction. They foster an environment where questioning is encouraged, critical thinking is developed, and practical application takes precedence over rote memorization.

This approach became particularly evident during our Java programming modules. Working collaboratively on group projects, we implemented the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern from the ground up. The emphasis wasn't merely on producing functional code, but on understanding design principles that promote maintainability, scalability, and clean architecture.

## Managing Student Life and Financial Independence

Living abroad as a student requires balancing academic responsibilities with financial realities. To support myself while studying, I began working as an Uber Eats courier, which initially seemed disconnected from my academic pursuits.

However, this experience proved surprisingly valuable. The flexible scheduling allowed me to maintain focus on my studies while providing practical benefits â€“ I gained intimate knowledge of Antwerp's geography, developed time management skills, and learned to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. The contrast between debugging code in the morning and navigating city streets in the evening taught me versatility and resilience.

## Building Academic and Social Communities

The international environment at KdG has been instrumental in my university experience. While I've connected with students from diverse backgrounds, forming friendships with fellow Bulgarian students created a particularly strong support network.

These relationships extend beyond casual social interaction. We collaborate on programming assignments, share study resources, support each other through challenging coursework, and create a sense of community that makes studying abroad more manageable and enjoyable. This blend of international exposure and cultural familiarity has enriched both my academic and personal development.

## Developing Technical and Life Skills

My time at KdG has encompassed much more than computer science curriculum. Through Java development projects, understanding architectural patterns like MVP, collaborative programming, and managing real-world responsibilities, I've developed both technical competencies and practical life skills.

The combination of rigorous academic work, part-time employment, and building meaningful relationships in a new country has taught me valuable lessons about adaptability, time management, and personal growth that extend well beyond university.

## Moving Forward

These initial months at KdG have established a strong foundation for my continued studies in computer science. The supportive academic environment, diverse student community, and practical learning opportunities have exceeded my expectations and prepared me well for the challenges ahead.

# From Bulgaria to Belgium: A Student's Journey

A year ago, the idea of spending my days programming, evenings capturing Antwerp through my camera lens, and Thursday nights exploring the city's vibrant student scene would have seemed like an impossible combination. Yet this perfectly describes my current life as a computer science student at Karel de Grote University.

## Leaving Home for New Opportunities

Sliven will always hold a special place in my heart â€“ the familiar mountains, intimate streets, and close-knit community that shaped my early years. However, I found myself seeking something beyond comfort and familiarity. I wanted academic challenges, diverse experiences, and opportunities that would accelerate my personal and professional development.

When I received acceptance to KdG's Computer Science program, I recognized it as the gateway to these aspirations. With one carefully packed suitcase, I embarked on this transformative journey to Belgium.

## Discovering Antwerp

My first impressions of Antwerp were immediately striking â€“ the ubiquitous cycling culture and my complete dependence on navigation apps to find my way around the city. However, Antwerp's charm reveals itself gradually and irresistibly.

The city offers a captivating blend of historic European architecture and contemporary international culture. Walking from medieval churches to modern cafes where multiple languages flow seamlessly in conversation creates a daily reminder of the rich cultural diversity that surrounds student life here.

## Academic Excellence at KdG

KdG's approach to computer science education emphasizes critical thinking and practical problem-solving over rote memorization. We engage with real-world projects, tackle complex challenges, and develop resilience when facing difficult concepts.

While academically demanding, this intensity creates an environment conducive to genuine learning. My first group programming project taught me fundamental lessons about collaborative development and the essential role of effective teamwork in successful software creation.

## Continuing Creative Pursuits

Initially, I worried that university commitments might limit my videography interests. Instead, Antwerp has provided an inspiring backdrop for creative exploration.

From capturing FPV drone footage over the Cathedral to documenting the rhythm of cyclists navigating cobblestone streets, the city offers endless visual storytelling opportunities. I've discovered that videography and programming share common principles â€“ both require patience, attention to detail, and persistence in pursuing perfection.

## Balancing Academic and Social Life

Student life extends beyond academic pursuits. Thursday evenings often find my friends and me at Red & Blue, one of Antwerp's well-known venues, where coursework concerns fade and we simply enjoy the present moment.

These experiences serve as important reminders that studying abroad encompasses more than academic achievement â€“ it's about creating meaningful experiences and lasting memories that define the university years.

## Reflecting on Growth

The transition from Sliven to Antwerp represents more than a geographical change. I've discovered a sustainable balance between academic dedication, creative expression, and social engagement that defines my current student experience.

Sliven provided my foundation and values; Antwerp is shaping my future possibilities. This journey feels like the beginning of something much larger than I initially imagined.
