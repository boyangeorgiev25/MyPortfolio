# From Failure to Growth: How My First Year Taught Me Resilience

As I sit here writing this, just days before my upcoming retake exam, I can't help but reflect on what has been an incredible journey of ups, downs, and unexpected discoveries during my first year at KdG.

## The Reality Check

Let me be honest – my first year didn't go exactly as planned. While I managed to pass most of my subjects, there was one that got the better of me. At first, I felt disappointed and frustrated with myself. Here I was, having to redo an exam while my classmates moved forward. But sometimes life has a funny way of turning what seems like a setback into an opportunity for growth.

The retake is scheduled for just a few days from now, and instead of dwelling on the past, I've chosen to see this as a second chance to truly master the material. Sometimes we need that extra time to let concepts sink in properly.

## An Unexpected Friendship

One of the best things that came out of my first year wasn’t related to academics at all — it was the friendships I formed with several Bulgarian classmates. What started as casual chats between classes quickly grew into a genuine group connection that ended up shaping my entire summer.

There’s something special about international friendships in college. You get to see the world through different perspectives, learn about new cultures, and realize that despite our different backgrounds, we share so many common dreams and experiences as students.

## A Week to Remember

After finishing our first year (well, mostly finishing in my case!), my Bulgarian friends and I decided to go on a week-long vacation together. It was exactly what I needed after the stress of exams and the disappointment of that one failed subject.

That week was pure magic. We explored new places, tried different foods, shared stories about our respective cultures, and just enjoyed being young and free from academic pressure. There’s nothing quite like traveling with good friends to put things in perspective. My academic struggles suddenly felt much smaller when measured against the vastness of new experiences and the strength of these friendships.

Those seven days reminded me that life is about so much more than grades and exams. It’s about the connections we make, the memories we create, and the person we become through our experiences.
## Turning Summer into an Investment

When we returned from our vacation, I had a choice to make. I could spend the rest of my summer worrying about the retake, or I could use this time productively while still preparing for my exam. I chose the latter.

I enrolled in a React course on Udemy, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made. While my friends were enjoying their well-deserved break, I was diving deep into the world of React development. But here's the thing – it didn't feel like work. It felt like discovery.

## From Learning to Creating

The React course opened up a whole new world for me. Suddenly, I wasn't just learning theory from textbooks – I was building actual projects, seeing immediate results, and understanding how code translates into real, functional applications.

The best part? I started building projects for my personal website. What began as practice exercises from the course evolved into a portfolio that I'm genuinely proud of. Each project taught me something new, and before I knew it, I had created a website that people are actually visiting and engaging with.


*Wish me luck on my retake – and thank you for following along on this journey!*

# First Months in ACS KdG

When I first arrived in Antwerp to start my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences (KdG), I wasn't sure what to expect. New country, new language, new system of education — it's a lot to take in. But honestly? It didn't take long before I started enjoying it.

⸻

## The Lecturers Made the Difference

One of the first things that surprised me was how much I liked the lecturers at KdG. They're not just there to throw theory at you and leave — they actually care if you understand the material. They encourage questions, push you to think, and make sure you can apply what you've learned in real projects.

That approach really helped me when we started working in Java. Our group built several projects from scratch, and I learned how to use and truly understand the MVP (Model–View–Presenter) pattern. It wasn't just about making the code work — it was about structuring it so it was clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

⸻

## Balancing Uni and Work

Of course, studying abroad isn't just lectures and assignments. Life here is expensive, so I had to find a job. That's when I started working as an Uber Eats courier.

It was… different. One moment I was debugging code in class, the next I was cycling through Antwerp delivering food in the rain. But in a weird way, it worked. The job gave me freedom to work on my own schedule, and it also helped me explore the city faster than Google Maps ever could.

⸻

## Building My Circle

One of the best parts about KdG has been the people. I made friends from all over, but especially from Bulgaria. I didn't expect to find so many Bulgarians here, and we clicked instantly. We've worked together on coding projects, shared meals, helped each other with assignments, and built friendships that go way beyond the classroom.

That mix of international classmates and a strong Bulgarian crew has made studying here a lot easier — and a lot more fun.

⸻

## Looking Back

Studying at KdG has been more than just learning Computer Science. It's been about building skills, building friendships, and building a life in a new country. Between Java projects, MVP architecture, late-night debugging, and delivering meals on my bike, I've learned more about resilience and connection than I ever expected.

And I'm just getting started.

# Moving Abroad: The Real Game Changer

If you told me a year ago I'd be coding in the day, filming at sunset, and dancing until 4 a.m. on Thursdays — all in Antwerp — I wouldn't have believed you.

But that's exactly how my life looks now. I moved from Bulgaria, to study for my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Karel de Grote University, and somewhere along the way, I built a whole new life I didn't see coming.

## Leaving Sliven for Something Bigger

Sliven will always be home — the mountains, the small streets, the familiar faces. But I wanted more than just comfort. I wanted challenges, new experiences, and opportunities that would push me forward.

When I got accepted into KdG's Computer Science program, I knew it was my chance. One suitcase later, I was on a plane to Belgium.

⸻

## Antwerp: First Impressions

The first thing I noticed? Bikes. Everywhere. And the second thing? I had absolutely no idea how to get around without Google Maps.

But Antwerp grows on you quickly. The mix of old European architecture with a modern, international vibe is addictive. One moment you're passing medieval churches, the next you're grabbing bubble tea next to a group speaking three different languages.

⸻

## Studying at KdG

KdG isn't about memorizing code — it's about learning how to think. We're building real projects, solving real problems, and getting pushed to figure things out even when it's hard.

It's intense, but that's what makes it good. My first group project showed me the two golden rules: teamwork is everything, and coffee is the second most important thing in life.

⸻

## My Camera Never Stayed in the Drawer

I thought uni life would put my videography on hold, but Antwerp is basically one big film set.

From FPV drone dives over the Cathedral to slow-motion shots of cyclists on cobblestone streets, there's always something worth capturing. Videography and coding might sound worlds apart, but they both need patience, detail, and the stubbornness to make things work perfectly.

⸻

## Thursday Nights

Not everything here is about work and projects. Every Thursday, my friends and I head to Red & Blue, one of the most famous spots in Antwerp's nightlife. It's where assignments don't matter, the music takes over, and you just live in the moment.

It's a good reminder that studying abroad isn't only about grades — it's about making memories that stick.

⸻

## Why I'm Glad I Moved

Moving from Sliven to Antwerp was more than just changing cities. I've found a balance between studying hard, staying creative, and enjoying student life.

Sliven gave me my roots; Antwerp is giving me my future. And I feel like this is just the beginning.
